# Project__1_Carmen_Luis
This is an demo project of a restaurant website that simulates a fast-food restaurant with sections such as menu, services, contact, mission, subscription form, and much more.

The website is designed to showcase a restaurant's services, including:
- A header with clear navigation
- Main banner with featured image
- Statistics section
- "About Us" section
- Mission section
- Contact form
- Newsletter subscription
- Footer with quick links and contact information

Everything was built using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on achieving a clean, structured, and professional design. HTML – for the semantic structure of the page
CSS3 – for visual styles (colors, fonts, spacing, flexbox)
Flexbox – for the layout of elements
Google Fonts – for improving typography
Font Awesome – for visual icons
